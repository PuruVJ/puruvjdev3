ðŸ‘‹ there! This article is about opening students' eyes about how much perks they can get if they apply for a Github Student Pack.

I am student at the time of writing (December 2020), and just got admission to an engineering college for my higher studies. I very recently applied for the Github Student Pack and got it. One of the happiest day of my life, as now I could use a lot of the paid programmes that I always wanted, for free!!

# What is Github?

Github is an online platform where you can host your code, collaborate on projects, and overall just manage your code really well using the <mark>Version Control System</mark> called [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

Github is based on <mark>Git</mark>, which is a necessity in today's world if you wish to work on code projects in collaboration with other developers, or heck, once you get the hang of it, you will always use it on your personal projects too.

Github is the biggest player out of all the platforms based on Git, and offers damn too many great services and offers.

# Perks for Students, eh?

Yup. Github offers the <mark>Github Student Developer pack</mark>, which is for all the students currently studying under an institution, like a school or university, and doing some engineering related course or work.

> You don't have to be doing a programming course in your college or school to apply. You could be a student in high school or a law university, and still be able to apply for a Student pack.

**And it's 100% free.**

The amount of perks you get from Github Student Pack are just unparalleled and you'll thank yourself in future if you get it now.

According to Github, the value provided by the pack is **12,000 USD** per student ðŸ˜®.

Mind blowing isn't it? It's a great time to be a Student Developer.

You also get Github Pro free in it until you're a student. It gets you the Pro badge on your github profile. I dunno how much good stuff you get from Github Pro, but the badge sure looks great ðŸ˜‰.

Check out [my profile](https://github.com/PuruVJ) to see the pro badge.

This topic is way too big to cover myself, and I suggest you to head over to this [Github Blog Post about Student Developer Pack](https://github.blog/2019-07-30-how-to-get-the-github-student-developer-pack-without-a-student-id/). They have written it better than I ever could Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯
