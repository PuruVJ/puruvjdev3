title: 'macOS Web: From Preact to Svelte'
description: I recently moved macOS web from Preact to Svelte. Here's the firsthand account of my experience.

macOS is an amazing operating system. It looks really good, works really fast(Thanks to Apple's hardware), is very consistent, and overall an amazing experience.

Personally, I have never been much infatuated with macOS. That changed last year, when macOS Big Sur came out with the super sleek and modern design with those beautiful blurs. I instantly fell in love with it üòç. Just look how beautiful it is üòå.

Unfortunately, I couldn't afford to buy the MacBook(You're overpriced, Apple üòë), but I couldn't not want it. I spent weeks just watching review videos, screenshots of it. I am not a designer, but I have a good taste in design, and Big Sur was it! Finally when the craving became too much, I was like, _"Screw it! I'll just make it myself"_

![Fine... I'll do it myself, quoted by Thanos](../../static/media/macos-preact-to-svelte--fine-i-will-do-it-myself.gif)

So that's what I did üòÅ. I recreated the interface of macOS Big Sur for Web. You can see it @ [macos.vercel.app](https://macos.vercel.app).

# Early days (React)!

I began working on this project back in November 2020, where I created just the topbar(without the opening menus), the animated dock, and the background. Nothing much, really. Quite easy to do. You can visit it here [macos-web-mmo5af3r6.vercel.app](https://macos-web-mmo5af3r6.vercel.app/)

If you look closely, the dock animation isn't as smooth as it is in the latest iteration. Not to mention, this very simple app is using loads of dependencies. It loaded <mark>146KB</mark> min+brotli of JS, and 0KB of CSS(It was CSS-in-JS, so no separate JS file). For reference, the current version in Svelte loads only <mark>28.5KB</mark> of JS, and <mark>3.6KB</mark> of CSS, and it does a **lot** more than the November version.

Here's the `package.json` dependencies of the November version üëá

```json
{
  "@material-ui/core": "^4.11.0",
  "@mdi/js": "^5.8.55",
  "@rooks/use-raf": "^4.0.2",
  "@tippyjs/react": "^4.2.0",
  "date-fns": "^2.16.1",
  "framer-motion": "^2.9.4",
  "react": "^17.0.1",
  "react-dom": "^17.0.1",
  "react-helmet-async": "^1.0.7",
  "restater": "0.0.12",
  "use-sound": "^2.0.1"
}
```

See?! So much stuff for so little!

So this was the state of the app. Then I didn't work on it. I was bored of it. . Then I had a road accident, broke my spine, was prescribed to bedrest for 3 months. I was bored out of my mind, so I thought, what the heck, I'll just continue working on it. So revived the project, made some heavy changes. Like I threw away `restater` library to use [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai), because it was much more simpler.

Fast forward two months, I made some drastic changes. I replaced Snowpack(Bundler and dev server) with [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/). Why? No specific reason, I just felt it was more polished and had some superb features which I could use to make the app smaller in size.

I replaced the existing JSS style with `styled-components`. Not perf related really, just that writing CSS as JS objects wasn't fun.

I also got rid of some dependencies to reduce bundle size.
