BLOG. EVERY. SINGLE. WEEK!!

That's it. That's the reminder for myself.

If you look closely at my blog posts, they seem to follow a pattern.

Look at the 2 blog posts on top, which I have connected with a red line. There's a 3 month difference in there. You'll notice a similar pattern if you go down, that there's a huge gap in between.

I'm not consistent at all.

So I'm putting this out there. A \[VERY] Public reminder for myself. Now that it is here, I'll be forced to write blog posts every week.
