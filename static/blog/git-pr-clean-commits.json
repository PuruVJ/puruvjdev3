I made only 2 commits related to this PR, but as you can see, this includes a lot of commits (19 to be exact). The thing is that it was 15 commits in the previous PR, and around 13 in the one before. As you can see, these commits are just adding on. The next PR I make would have all these included plus the new commits.</p>\n<p>There are 2 reasons why it happens:</p>\n<h2 id=\"Making-PRs-from-one-single-branch\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"blog/git-pr-clean-commits#Making-PRs-from-one-single-branch\">#</a>Making PRs from one single branch</h2>\n<p>If you keep making PRs from one single branch, whether it be a new branch you created, or it be <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>, the previous commits will keep adding up, the files involved in each ones will keep piling up too.</p>\n<p>For example, you intended to make a PR with only 2 file changes, but your PR <strong>may</strong> show 10, or 20, or 30, or however number of files all those previous commits included.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Fault-in-our-stars-bots\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"blog/git-pr-clean-commits#Fault-in-our-stars-bots\">#</a>Fault in our <s>stars</s> bots</h2>\n<p>As you see in the photo above <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"👆\" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.0.2/svg/1f446.svg\">, you will see some commits by a bot too. Some repos have automated bots to take care of some things. Sometimes when you merge changes from upstream repo(AKA The original repo from which you forked), some bot commits may be included, and will pollute your own commits history.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If this explanation seems very incomplete or weird, is because of the fact that I don't know completely about these bot commits. Please do your own research about this if you can(and tell me too <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"😋\" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.0.2/svg/1f60b.svg\">).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"How-do-I-get-rid-of-these-stowaway-commit\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"blog/git-pr-clean-commits#How-do-I-get-rid-of-these-stowaway-commit\">#</a>How do I get rid of these stowaway commit?</h1>\n<p>All you have to do is run these commands</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #292D3E\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">git checkout main</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">git reset --hard upstream/main</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">git push --force</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><code>git checkout main</code> just checkouts to your <code>main</code> branch.
