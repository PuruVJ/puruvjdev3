That's about 6 years now. In that time I have done HTML CSS JavaScript, it's supersets TypeScript(My most favorite language of all time <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"圭" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f60c.svg\">) and Dart, Python as a form of timepass, and C and C++ in university curriculum.</p>\n<p>Recently, Golang caught my eye. So I had been casually reading its documentation, the tutorial, some articles. Not really trying it out, in the sense opening VSCode and writing the code. That didn't happen.</p>\n<p>I was just trying to get a feel for the patterns. Because the more sources you learn from, the better you become, no matter if the context is entirely different. Concepts and Patterns bleed over to other things.</p>\n<p>Now here's one thing about me: I am a die-hard JavaScripter(That's not an official term, but who cares, let's consider it is, for now <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"欺" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f60b.svg\">). I write everything in JavaScript or TypeScript(Basically JavaScript with Types and futuristic features). Whether it's an app, or a small script or heck, even something where using Python\nwould be better, I still go with JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Why? Because JavaScript is extremely flexible. As a language alone, it can literally do <strong>anything</strong>. It is a very simple language. There are a dozen ways to do anything in it. Then you include the <strong>Modular</strong> aspect of it in the equation, like <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NPM</a>, and JavaScript reaches a godly level.</p>\n<p>Yet at the same time, it is explicit enough. You have to declare variable first before using it using <code>const</code> or <code>let</code>, unlike Python, which leads to confusion about <strong>where</strong> the variable is coming from!!</p>\n<p>JavaScript uses curly braces for blocks instead of indentation. People would say Python looks cleaner without those braces, and I agree. It <strong>looks</strong> cleaner. But while reading, that indentation confuses me, as in, the line I'm reading belongs to which block exactly. Plus writing it is really risky. You might end up accidentally removing indentation from a line at the end of a block and it becomes a part of the outer block. It <strong>has happened to me</strong>, countless times.</p>\n<p>These are some reasons why JavaScript is my favorite. So where does Go factor in on it?</p>\n<p>Let's see!</p>\n<h1 id=\"TLDR\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#TLDR\">#</a>TLDR</h1>\n<p>Sorry, there's no TLDR for this article. It's just a documentation of my experience <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"･ｲ\" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f972.svg\">.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Disclaimer\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#Disclaimer\">#</a>Disclaimer</h1>\n<p>Before we start, here's something I wanna make clear: This isn't an organized technical article about pros and cons of Go or JavaScript. This is a completely Subjective article about what <strong>I like</strong> about Go and what I don't like about it.</p>\n<p>If yur here for a hardcore, informative article about Go and JavaScript, I might disappoint you <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f605.svg\">.</p>\n<p>But hey, if you wanna read first hand experience, this is it!! Read on!! <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"､ｩ\" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f929.svg\"></p>\n<p>So with that out of the way, let's begin!</p>\n<h1 id=\"Why-even-try-Go\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#Why-even-try-Go\">#</a>Why even try Go?</h1>\n<p>This is a valid question. You saw I know many languages, and even on top of that, I use JavaScript for everything. So what gives? Why try to fit another language in my tiny brain?</p>\n<p>The problem was when JS was way too big!!</p>\n<p>What do I mean by that? Let's rewind a little!!</p>\n<h1 id=\"The-lazy-undergraduate\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#The-lazy-undergraduate\">#</a>The lazy undergraduate</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Spoiler: I am the lazy undergraduate in question <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"Ы" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f604.svg\">.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I took admission in university a few months back. Thanks to Covid-19, our classes are fully online. It means there are a bunch of Google meet links that I had to hunt for, for every class.</p>\n<p>So the actual process was:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open up the timetable every hour and see which class is next.</li>\n<li>If there's a class in next hour, find out its link.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Believe me or not, this process took 5 minutes. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME! 5 minutes isn't a lot, but you count these 5 minutes for every time I had to it, and combine it, that's around 10+ hours wasted just for finding the link.</p>\n<p>And worse than that is the repetition. As a programmer, you know how horrible it is do the same boring task again and again. And unlike non-programmers, you can't accept the situation and get used to it. You have to automate it, even if it takes hours.</p>\n<p><img src=\"\" alt=\"Can this 5 minute task be automated?\" style=\"display: none;\"></p><div class=\"picture-container\">\n  <figure style=\"width: 100%;--padding-top: 89.91666666666667%;\">\n    <picture>\n      <source type=\"image/jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 501px)\" data-srcset=\"../media/golang-as-javascripter--is-this-meme/large.jpg\">\n      <source type=\"image/jpg\" media=\"(max-width: 500px)\" data-srcset=\"../media/golang-as-javascripter--is-this-meme/small.jpg\">\n      <img alt=\"Can this 5 minute task be automated?\" data-src=\"../media/golang-as-javascripter--is-this-meme/large.jpg\" class=\"lazyload blog-img\">\n    </picture>\n  </figure>\n  </div><p></p>\n<p>So hey, that's what I did!!</p>\n<p>I created a script that would run in the background, and open the class link in the browser 5 minutes before the class started.

I could write code in my favorite language, and convert it over to an executable that I could configure to run on System startup, so I'd never have to run it myself ever again.</p>\n<p><img src=\"\" alt=\"Perfection meme from X Men\" style=\"display: none;\"></p><div class=\"picture-container\">\n  <div class=\"gif-vid-container\">\n    <video autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\">\n      <source src=\"../media/golang-as-javascripter--xmen-perfection-meme/vidgif.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n      Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video playback. <a href=\"../media/golang-as-javascripter--xmen-perfection-meme.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">See the gif here</a>\n    </video>\n  </div>\n  </div><p></p>\n<p>Only it wasn't perfect <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"､申" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f910.svg\"><img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"､申" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f910.svg\"></p>\n<p>The code itself was amazingly easy to write. I completed it in 3 hours, because I was so familiar with TypeScript.</p>\n<p>But where the issue was while compiling the code into an executable.</p>\n<p>The executable's size was <mark>56 MB</mark> for windows, and as high as <mark>90MB</mark> for MacOS M1.</p>\n<p>56MB isn't a lot for me. Even 90 MB is nothing. But it kept nagging at me. I try to keep the sizes of apps/websites as low as I can, and 56MB felt just way too big for that.</p>\n<p>And not only that. Because I had made this project public(Here it is: <a href=\"https://github.com/PuruVJ/auto-class-launcher-deno\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PuruVJ/auto-class-launcher-deno</a>) and usable for everyone, my batchmates tried to use it, and well, 60-90Mb was way too big for them, due to limited internet and all.</p>\n<p>So I got a good excuse to re-write it.</p>\n<p>Node was out of question because any script in it would require NodeJS to be installed on the system and overall a more complicated process.</p>\n<p>I turned towards Rust! I had been jumping to learn Rust for quite some time, cuz of its performance and modernity and all that stuff.</p>\n<p>But oh boy, Rust was hard. Extremely hard!! I gave up after a few hours.</p>\n<p>Then, I finally turned towards Go!!</p>\n<h1 id=\"Learning-Go\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#Learning-Go\">#</a>Learning Go</h1>\n<p>I sat down at night to make it. I created the project, initialized the Go boilerplate(which is just a <code>go.mod</code> file and a <code>main.go</code> with 4 lines of code), <strong>then</strong> I opened up the Go Tutorial.</p>\n<p>Yeah, this might seem strange to you. Initialize a project, and <strong>then</strong> start learning that thing? Why would you do that??</p>\n<p>Well, I'm a huge proponent of <mark>Learning by Doing</mark>, where you learn the bare minimum upfront, and the rest you learn by trying to make a small project in it. It makes you learn the thing the hard way, but really fast, without wasting any time on trivialities.</p>\n<p>In case of Go, though, I didn't need anything upfront, cuz I had seen the syntax before a bit and it looked simple enough to me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Spoiler: Learning by Doing really works, I learnt basic Go in 3-4 hours only <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"噂" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f609.svg\"></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"Results\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#Results\">#</a>Results</h1>\n<p>Before I jump into the experience, here's the straight up results <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"燥\" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f447.svg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"\" alt=\"Comparison of the binary size and memory consumption generated by Deno and Go\" style=\"display: none;\"></p><div class=\"picture-container\">\n  <figure style=\"width: 100%;--padding-top: 46.75%;\">\n    <picture>\n      <source type=\"image/png\" media=\"(min-width: 501px)\" data-srcset=\"../media/golang-as-javascripter--go-vs-deno-size-comparison/large.png\">\n      <source type=\"image/png\" media=\"(max-width: 500px)\" data-srcset=\"../media/golang-as-javascripter--go-vs-deno-size-comparison/small.png\">\n      <img alt=\"Comparison of the binary size and memory consumption generated by Deno and Go\" data-src=\"../media/golang-as-javascripter--go-vs-deno-size-comparison/large.png\" class=\"lazyload blog-img\">\n    </picture>\n  </figure>\n  </div><p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you're unable to read the image(Screenreader/Slow network), it's a comparison table showing Deno generated binary size to be <strong>57 - 90MB</strong> and memory consumption to be <strong>6 - 11MB</strong>, whereas with Go, the binary size is <strong>2.6 - 2.9MB</strong>, and RAM consumption is <strong>1.5 - 7MB</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mindblown right <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"､ｯ\" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f92f.svg\">?! Such a huge difference in the binary size.

Read on!!</p>\n<p>So I migrated the whole app to Go, (mostly) bug free, in 1 day.</p>\n<p>And here's my observations, as an avid JavaScripter learning Go for the very first time!!</p>\n<h2 id=\"It-isn't-much-different-(Positively-)!!\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#It-isn't-much-different-(Positively-)!!\">#</a>It isn't much different (Positively <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"凾\" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f642.svg\">)!!</h2>\n<p>Really, that's the first point I noticed about it. It isn't much different from JavaScript. There are variables, functions, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>switch</code> blocks, Error handling system and what not.</p>\n<p>That is the main point of Go, really!! It combines all the knowledge of 60 years of programming into a very simple language which doesn't invent a lot of new stuff. Rather, it focuses on problems that aren't even code related, which are just as important as the code itself, like feature creep, standard formatting, great package management system and stuff that isn't answered well enough in a majority of languages to the day.</p>\n<p>OFC, it depends on how comfortable you're with programming languages, generally, but if you're very comfortable with TypeScript or Dart or any other statically typed language, you'll feel right at home with Go.</p>\n<p>But even then, it isn't necessary to know a Statically typed language before, as Go will infer as much of the types as it can without you needing to tell it much.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Variables-are-Pythonic-but-not-quite...\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#Variables-are-Pythonic-but-not-quite...\">#</a>Variables are Pythonic, but not quite...</h2>\n<p>Here's how JavaScript variables are defined.</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #292D3E\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #676E95; font-style: italic\">// Declare variable</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #C792EA\">let</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> someVal</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">someVal </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">=</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">'</span><span style=\"color: #C3E88D\">hello</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">'</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #676E95; font-style: italic\">// Set it to something later on</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">someVal </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">=</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">'</span><span style=\"color: #C3E88D\">world</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">'</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>If you wanna do it explicitly in TypeScript,</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #292D3E\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #C792EA\">let</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> someVal</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">:</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #FFCB6B\">string</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">someVal </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">=</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">'</span><span style=\"color: #C3E88D\">hello</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">'</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #676E95; font-style: italic\">// Set it to something later on</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">someVal </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">=</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">'</span><span style=\"color: #C3E88D\">world</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">'</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>OFC, TypeScript is intelligent and you don't always need to specify types for a variable.</p>\n<p>As you can see, it's <strong>extremely clear</strong> where this variable is defined. You are scrolling through a file, there's the big <code>const</code> and <code>let</code> glaring right at you. The source is extremely clear.</p>\n<p>Now let's come to Python.</p>\n<p>The above example of declaring a variable here <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"燥\" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f447.svg\"></p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #292D3E\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">someVal </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">=</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">'</span><span style=\"color: #C3E88D\">hello</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">'</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #676E95; font-style: italic\"># Set it to something later on</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">someVal </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">=</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">'</span><span style=\"color: #C3E88D\">world</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">'</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>Can you the declaration part and the part where we set it's value to something, later on in the program? There's no difference. No way to know where this variable was defined.</p>\n<p>It's irritating in my opinion. There needs to be some distinction between the two!!</p>\n<p>Now, why I talk about Python variables? Cuz Golang variables, in their simplest form, are very much like Python variables, but they have one extra character that prevents the confusion that Python variables introduce. That character is <code>:</code></p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #292D3E\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">someVal </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">:=</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">\"</span><span style=\"color: #C3E88D\">hello</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #676E95; font-style: italic\">// Set it to something later on</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">someVal </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">=</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">\"</span><span style=\"color: #C3E88D\">Hello</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>1st time, I'm declaring the variable using the <code>:=</code> operator. But when setting its value later in the program, I use the regular <code>=</code> operator.</p>\n<p>This is a small thing, but it makes a huge difference!! I even actually prefer it over JavaScript's <code>let</code> variable declaration. It is cleaner, but not <strong>so clean</strong> it sacrifices developer ergonomics.</p>\n<p>And if you prefer a more verbose way, that's there too</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #292D3E\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">var</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> someVal </span><span style=\"color: #C792EA\">string</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">=</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">\"</span><span style=\"color: #C3E88D\">hello</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>Just like JavaScript's <code>var someVal = \"hello\"</code>, but here the data type is necessary. If you're a TypeScripter, you'll feel right at home here.</p>\n<p>And ofc, you also have <code>const</code> in go, and its declaration is the exact same as doing it in JavaScript</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #292D3E\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">const</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> someVal </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">=</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">\"</span><span style=\"color: #C3E88D\">hello</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>I really love the fact that Go goes the extra length to keep the code clean, but doesn't shy away from providing the standard, more verbose APIs when they're needed. It's the best of both worlds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Type-System\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#Type-System\">#</a>Type System</h2>\n<p>Go's Type system is similar to the type system of TypeScript, where most of the time, you don't even need to specify types for your variables.</p>\n<p>In TypeScript, this below:</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #292D3E\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #C792EA\">const</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> x </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">=</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">'</span><span style=\"color: #C3E88D\">hello</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">'</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>is inferred as <code>string</code> automatically. Same with number or boolean or just anything.</p>\n<p>Go works like this too!!</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #292D3E\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">x </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">:=</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">\"</span><span style=\"color: #C3E88D\">hello</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>is inferred as <code>string</code>.

Sure, it has some really good global functions that you can snatch up and use directly, but they don't qualify as <strong>standard lib</strong>.</p>\n<p>Go is the opposite. By default, globally, it doesn't provide much.</p>\n<p>But you start importing stuff from the built in standard library, you can achieve a lot!!</p>\n<p>Want JSON? Import <code>json</code> package, and use it.</p>\n<p>Need to do math? Import <code>math</code> package, and use it!!</p>\n<p>But you're wondering, doesn't that add an extra step over just using the <code>Math.*</code> and <code>JSON.*</code> objects of JavaScript? Yes, it does!</p>\n<p>But that doesn't mean the Go is bad for not having global objects like these, or JS is bad for having global objects that are just lying around in the namespace. No.</p>\n<p>Go is a compiled language. It takes all the code you wrote, inlines everything you imported, and then convert it to machine level code. JS on the other hand is an interpreted language. What you write is what is executed in the browser ultimately, no conversion required. So there, having these objects available isn't a big problem.</p>\n<p>But in Go, if you include every in-built module by default, it's final output size is gonna be <strong>huge</strong>. No one likes huge file sizes. So by importing only what you need, output size stays small.</p>\n<p>And the standard library has just so much more stuff than <code>Math</code> and <code>json</code> packages. It has packages that in Node/Deno world, you'd be installing from npm/pulling it with a URL.</p>\n<p>Here are some great libs <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"燥\" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f447.svg\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>bytes</strong> - Dealing with Byte slices</li>\n<li><strong>context</strong> - Defines the Context type, which carries deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes.</li>\n<li><strong>database</strong> - Interfaces for dealing with Databases(SQL only, at the moment)</li>\n<li><strong>embed</strong> - For embedding resources into your final binary so no need to ship many different files</li>\n<li><strong>time</strong> - For dealing with dates and times.</li>\n<li><strong>flag</strong> - Package flag implements command-line flag parsing. This is really shocking to me IMO, cuz in Node and Deno, you always have to pull in another library for dealing with CLIs. And here, you're getting that literally built-in <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"仆\" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f63b.svg\"></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's so much more great stuff in Go Standard Library!!
