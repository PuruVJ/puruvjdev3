I have been into coding since early 2015. That's about 6 years now. In that time I have done HTML CSS JavaScript, it's supersets TypeScript(My most favorite language of all time ðŸ˜Œ) and Dart, Python as a form of timepass, and C and C++ in university curriculum.

Very recently, I had been interested in Golang. Been casually reading its documentation, the tutorial, some articles. Not really trying it out, in the sense opening VSCode and writing the code. That didn't happen.

Now here's one thing about me: I am a die-hard JavaScripter(That's not an official term, but who cares, let's consider it is, for now ðŸ˜‹). I write everything in JavaScript or TypeScript(Basically JavaScript with Types and futuristic features). Whether it's an app, or a small script or heck, even something where using Python
